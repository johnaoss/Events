# Uncode Winter 2018

This was written during my first year of university at a "Uncode" party jointly hosted by WICS and the CSC.

The goal was to write the worst software possible within the given time, out of a predefined list of topics that I don't remember.

I chose fizzbuzz, written in JavaScript because I felt like that was slow enough.

It's bad.
